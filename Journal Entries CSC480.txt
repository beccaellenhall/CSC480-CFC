Met on 9th to go over ETL to DB. Nelson suggested looking at forecast performance. We weren't sure the scope of the project till after out meeting with Elaine on the 15th. We talked about their desires and she was game with the layout we had in Excel. All of us clarified any confusion. Narrowed focus to data warehouse, which would be beneficial for future forecasts.
